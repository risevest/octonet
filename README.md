## About

Octonet is an internal library (Rise) that provides utility functions for building microservices such as:

- Interservice communication (via REST)
- Subscribing to events from RabbitMQ queues and NATS servers.
- Logging
- Authentication

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development purposes.

### Prerequisites

The following are required for the best use of Octonet:

- Package Dependencies
  - NodeJs (v14 or higher)
  - Yarn
  - Typescript (v4.4 or higher)
- A basic understanding of dependency injection with Inversify

### Installation

To install Octonet, run the following command in your terminal

```bash
yarn install --save @risemaxi/octonet reflect-metadata
```

To upgrade to a specific version run this command

```bash
yarn upgrade @risemaxi/octonet@version
```

To upgrade to latest version run this command

```bash
yarn upgrade @risemaxi/octonet --latest
```

> Note: Octonet requires Typescript (>= v4.4), as well as the `Decorator` experimental feature. Therefore, the following config options should be present in your `tsconfig.json` file:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2017",
    "lib": ["es2017", "esnext.asynciterable", "dom"],
    "types": ["reflect-metadata"],
    "module": "commonjs",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "experimentalDecorators": true,
    "emitDecoratorMetadata": true
  }
}
```
